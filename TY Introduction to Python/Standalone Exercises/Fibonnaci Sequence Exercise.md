The Fibonacci sequence is a progression of numbers where each number in the sequence is the sum of the previous 2 numbers. e.g. 1,2,3,5,8,13.
This sequence can be found in many places in nature. 
> A perfect example of this is the nautilus shell, whose chambers adhere to the Fibonacci sequenceâ€™s logarithmic spiral almost perfectly. This famous pattern shows up everywhere in nature including flowers, pinecones, hurricanes, and even huge spiral galaxies in space.

## Pseudocode
This is where you plan out in simple language what you want your program to do. For this exercise the pseudocode may look something like this
1. Start with 2 numbers 0 and 1
2. The next number is the sum of the previous 2 numbers in the sequence
3. print the answer to this number
4. repeat
The above pseudocode is incomplete and does not go into specifics as to how this would be carried out.
### Task 01
Create pseudocode for a python program to find the first 10 steps in the Fibonacci sequence.
> **Hint**: Consider how many variables you may need to be able to carry out the steps and include this in the pseudocode
### Task 02
Using the Pseudocode as a guide create a python program to display the first 10 numbers in the sequence
> **Hint**: Use loops or iteration to streamline the code e.g. a *for* or *while* loop
### Task 03
Modify the code to display the first 100 in the sequence
### Task 04
Modify the code to ask the user how many items in the sequence they want to see
