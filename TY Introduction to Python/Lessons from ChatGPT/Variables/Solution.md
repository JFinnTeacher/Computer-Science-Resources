# Possible Solution
```python
# Step 1: Define variables
x = 5
y = 3
z = "Hello"

# Step 2: Print variables
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
print("z =", z)

# Step 3: Perform arithmetic operations
sum = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y

# Step 4: Print results
print("sum =", sum)
print("difference =", difference)
print("product =", product)

# Step 5: Create string variable
message = "The values of x and y are " + str(x) + " and " + str(y) + ", and the value of z is " + z + "."

# Step 6: Print message
print(message)

# Step 7: Check conditions
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif y > x:
    print("y is greater than x")
else:
    print("x and y are equal")

# Step 8: Use loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print("x:", i, "y:", i)

# Step 9: Ask for user input
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello", name + ",", "the value of x is", x)

```
