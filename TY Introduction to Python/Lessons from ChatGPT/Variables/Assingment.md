# Assignment Title: Using Variables in Python

**Instructions: For this assignment, you will create a Python program that uses variables to store and manipulate values. Follow the steps below:**

1.  Define three variables: x, y, and z. Assign integer values to x and y, and a string value to z.
    
2.  Print the values of x, y, and z.
    
3.  Using arithmetic operators, perform the following operations and store the results in new variables:
    
    -   Add x and y, and store the result in a variable called "sum".
    -   Subtract y from x, and store the result in a variable called "difference".
    -   Multiply x and y, and store the result in a variable called "product".
4.  Print the values of the new variables "sum", "difference", and "product".
    
5.  Use the string concatenation operator to create a new string variable called "message" that combines the values of x, y, and z into a single sentence. For example, if x=5, y=3, and z="Hello", the message should be "The values of x and y are 5 and 3, and the value of z is Hello."
    
6.  Print the value of the "message" variable.
    
7.  Use conditional statements to check the following conditions and print the appropriate message:
    
    -   If the value of x is greater than y, print "x is greater than y".
    -   If the value of y is greater than x, print "y is greater than x".
    -   If the values of x and y are equal, print "x and y are equal".
8.  Use a loop to print the values of x and y in the following pattern:
```text
x: 1, y: 1
x: 2, y: 2
x: 3, y: 3
...
x: 10, y: 10
```
9.  Hint: Use the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers.
    
2.  Use the input() function to ask the user for their name, and store the input in a variable called "name". Then, print a personalized message that includes the user's name and one of the variables you defined earlier. For example, "Hello John, the value of x is 5."
    

Submission Guidelines:

-   Save your Python program as a .py file and submit it via email or your preferred method of submission.
-   Be sure to include comments in your code to explain what each section of code does.
-   Test your code to ensure that it works correctly and produces the expected output.
-   Make sure your code is readable and well-formatted.
