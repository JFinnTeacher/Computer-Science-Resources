# Lesson 04 - Testing Code

## Extra Exercises

## Exercise 01

Copy the code below and run the code. Then carry out the following tasks

```python
# Program to add two numbers

num1 = input("Enter first number: ")
num2 = input("Enter second number: ")

sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum is: ", sm)
```

1. Identify any errors in the code and fix them so the code will run correctly
2. Add a Comment to the code that outlines what the error was and how it was fixed

## Exercise 02
