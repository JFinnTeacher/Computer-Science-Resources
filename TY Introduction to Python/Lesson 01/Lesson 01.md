## First Python Code
The most basic thing python can be used for is to work with text. Some of the terminology you need to know about is:
- Characters
	- A character is any single item that can be printed to the screen. This can be letters, Numbers or any other symbol the computer can display. Characters must be surrounded by “ ” or it will not display properly
- Strings
	- A string is any collection of 2 or more characters in a row. For Example this sentence is a string made up of letters, Spaces and symbols such as the comma and fullstop.
- Functions
	- A function is what a command is know as in Python. For Example the function to place text on to the screen is the print command and is structured as follows
	- print(“This is the print command”)
	- This will place the sentence **This is the print command** to the screen
	- Note the structure of the brackets and inverted commas to print a string to the screen
