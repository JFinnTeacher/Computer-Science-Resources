Click on the Repl button to create your first block of code
1. Under Template start typing python and choose Python as the template
2. It is important to give the Repl a recognisable name
3. finally click on the Blue Create Repl
#### Replit Window

The main parts of the Replit Window
A. The list of the files in the Repl. the file called main.py must be there as this is what is run.
B. Then main coding window. This is where the code is placed
C. The console window is where the output of the program goes
## First Python Code
The most basic thing python can be used for is to work with text. Some of the terminology you need to know about is:
- Characters
	- A character is any single item that can be printed to the screen. This can be letters, Numbers or any other symbol the computer can display. Characters must be surrounded by “ ” or it will not display properly
- Strings
	- A string is any collection of 2 or more characters in a row. For Example this sentence is a string made up of letters, Spaces and symbols such as the comma and fullstop.
- Functions
	- A function is what a command is know as in Python. For Example the function to place text on to the screen is the print command and is structured as follows
	- print(“This is the print command”)
	- This will place the sentence **This is the print command** to the screen
	- Note the structure of the brackets and inverted commas to print a string to the screen

## Practice Code
The best way to learn how a python program works is to practice it

Work through the exercises below to become familiar with the Print Command

## Exercises
### Exercise 01
#### Task 01
Using **one** print function, produce this output
> Hello world
#### Task 02
Using **two** print functions, produce this output
> Question. What do you call it when you have your mom's mom on social media?
>Answer. Instagran
#### Task 03
Using **one** print function and this code \U0001f600, produce this output
> 😀

***Hint* Even though this is a smiley face, you will still need to print the code like a string**

### Exercise 02
#### Task 01
Using **one** print function, produce this output
> I am learning how to use the newline and tab special characters.
