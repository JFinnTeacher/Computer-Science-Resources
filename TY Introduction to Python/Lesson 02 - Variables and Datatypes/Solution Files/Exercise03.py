#Lesson 02 Samples - Exercise 03

#Task 01 - Adding bits of strings together (Concatentation)
# Assigning Variables
name = "Johann"
age = "twenty five"
# Concatenting text
print("Hi "+ name +", You are "+ age +" years old.")

#Task 01 (Modified)- Adding bits of strings together (Concatentation)
# Assigning Variables
name = "Johann"
age = "twenty five"
town = "Kildare"
use = "train"
# Concatenting text
print("Hi "+ name +", You are "+ age +" years old and you live in "+ town + ". You travel to school by "+ use +".")

#Task 02 - Adding a number to a variable
#Assigning the value to the variable
x = 10
#Two print commands showing operations with the variable
print(x+5)
print(x+25)

#Task 03 - More complex operations
#Assigning the variables to calculate Area
house_length = 18
house_width = 12

#Commands to carry out the operation and return the correct values
print((house_length*2)+(house_width*2)) #PEMDAS to carry out the multiplication first then add the result
print(house_length+house_length+house_width+house_width) #More Straight Forward
