# Lesson 06 - Conditional Statements

## Exercise 01

### Task 1:

Take in an integer variable for your age from the user. Do this by using the input() function.

```python
age = int(input())
```

It is up to you if you want to prompt the user for input or leave the input function blank.

Check to see if the age of a person is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, print out that the person can vote; otherwise, print that they cannot vote.

### Task 2:

Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from user and check if it is square or not.

### Task 3:

Take two int values from user and print greatest among them.

## Exercise 02

### Task 1:

A school has following rules for grading system: 

- Below 25 - F 
- 25 to 45 - E 
- 45 to 50 - D 
- 50 to 60 - C 
- 60 to 80 - B 
- Above 80 - A 

Ask user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade.

### Task 2:

A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.

Ask user for quantity and suppose one unit will cost €100. 

Calculate and print total cost for user based on the number of units ordered

### Task 3:

Write a python program that uses if selection statements to print out the cost of a toll based on the type of vehicle. 

Declare a variable called vehicle. 

Your program should check the value of the character variable vehicle to see if it represents a car, a motorbike, a bus, a truck, or a van. 

Depending on the type of vehicle it should print out the appropriate toll price.

Use the table below to guide you writing the program:

| Type of Vehicle | Vehicle  Representation | Price |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| Car             | “c”                     | 2.00  |
| Motorbike       | “m”                     | 1.10  |
| Bus             | “b”                     | 4.25  |
| Truck           | “t”                     | 6.70  |
| Van             | “v”                     | 4.00  |

## Exercise 03

### Task 1:

Take input of age of 3 people by user using the input() function and determine oldest and youngest among them.

### Task 2:

Write a program that determines a number, either even or odd.

Your program should have a variable to store an integer number and print the appropriate message.
