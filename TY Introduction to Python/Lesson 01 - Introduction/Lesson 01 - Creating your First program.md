## Using the Print Command
Python uses the print function to output characters to the screen. Functions are case sensitive and must all be in lower case so python will recognise ***print*** as a command but ***Print*** will give an error message.

Open your IDE and type in the following

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Breakdown of the function
- print() - This is the function that tells python to place characters on the screen. The () is an important part of this as everything in the brackets will be printed to the screen
- "Hello World" - This is what will be output. Strings must be enclosed with " " to display properly.

## Working with Multiple lines of code
To print multiple lines of code you can simply use multiple print commands
```python
print("I'm learning to Code")
print("I'm using Python")
```
Python has a command that will force the text to move to a new line \n. By placing this in the string where you want the new line to start
```python
print("I'm learning to Code \nI'm using Python")
```
## Working with Tabs
The print command will reproduce whatever is between " " such as in the example below
```python
print("*    This text has spaces contained in it      *")
```
A similar effect can be easily created using the specialist tab command \t placed in a similar way to the new line command as shown below
```python
print("*\tThis text has spaces contained in it\t*")
```
