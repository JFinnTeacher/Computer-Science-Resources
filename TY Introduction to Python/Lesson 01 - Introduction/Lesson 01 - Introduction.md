## What is Python? 
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It's known for its clear syntax and readability, which reduces the cost of program maintenance. There are a number of advantages to learning and using Python as a programming language such as -
1. Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it a great language for beginners. It emphasizes code readability and allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.
2. Large and active community: Python has a vast community of developers who actively contribute to its growth and development. 
3. Cross-platform compatibility: Python is a highly portable language, meaning that code written in Python can run on various operating systems and platforms without any modifications. 
4. Strong support for scientific computing and data analysis: Python has become a popular language in the field of data science and scientific computing. 
5. Rapid prototyping: Python's simplicity and ease of use make it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping. Developers can quickly build and test ideas, iterate on them, and refine their solutions without getting bogged down by complex syntax or lengthy development cycles.
6. Automation and scripting: Python's scripting capabilities make it a popular choice for automation tasks and scripting. It can be used to automate repetitive tasks, interact with system resources, and create scripts for various purposes, such as system administration, data processing, and more.

Python is currently used in a number of ways such as:
1. Web Development: Python is widely used in web development for building scalable and secure web applications.
2. Data Science and Machine Learning: Python has become the go-to language for data science and machine learning tasks  providing powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models.
3. Scientific Computing: Python is extensively used in scientific computing for tasks such as numerical simulations, data visualization, and computational modelling.
4. Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing: Python is widely used in AI and NLP applications. Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK provide robust tools for building and training neural networks, natural language processing, and text analysis.
5. Automation and Scripting: Python's simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for automation and scripting tasks. It is commonly used for tasks like system administration, network automation, and data processing.
6. Game Development: Python is used in game development, both for building game engines and scripting game logic.
7. Web Scraping: Python's libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy make it easy to scrape data from websites. This is useful for tasks like data extraction, monitoring, and analysis.
8. Desktop GUI Applications: Python can be used to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces (GUI).

## Terminology associated with Programming and Python
You should be aware of the following terms when starting to work with text in Python
1. Character: In Python, a character is a single element of a string that represents a single Unicode character. It can be a letter, digit, symbol, or whitespace. Characters in Python are enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").
2. String: A string is a sequence of characters in Python. It is a data type that represents textual data. Strings can be created by enclosing characters within single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). For example, "Hello, World!" is a string in Python.
3. Function: In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Python has many built in functions or commands that you need to learn as part of any programming language but you can also define functions to carry out specific tasks in a program or script.
4. Script: In Python, a script refers to a file containing a sequence of Python statements or code that can be executed. It is a program written in the Python programming language that performs a specific task or set of tasks. 
5. IDE: IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides comprehensive tools and features to facilitate software development.

## Creating Code
There are a number of ways that you can create and run Python Code both online and using offline applications here is a list of some of the more common/popular methods

### Online IDEs
1. Replit: Replit is a popular online IDE that supports Python programming. It provides a web-based coding environment with features like code editing, execution, collaboration, and version control. Replit also offers a community where users can share and explore projects.
2. Trinket: Trinket (trinket.io) is an online platform that offers an interactive coding environment for Python and other programming languages. It allows users to write, run, and share Python code directly from their web browser. Trinket provides a simple and beginner-friendly interface, making it suitable for educational purposes and quick prototyping. It also supports collaborative coding and provides features like version control and project sharing.
