# Teacher Guide – ALT 3 Modelling & Simulation

## Timing
- Exercise 1: 20–25 minutes
- Exercise 2: 25–30 minutes
- Plenary reflection: 10 minutes

## Learning Outcomes
- 3.8 Scenario testing via parameters
- 3.9 Interpretation before/after changes
- 3.10 (Exercise 2) Emergent behaviour from local rules

## Differentiation
- Support
  - Provide early-stop snippet for Exercise 1.
  - Suggest parameter sets (e.g., harvest = 1200, 1500, 2000).
- Stretch
  - Add logistic growth (carrying capacity K) in Exercise 1.
  - Add meeting point or maskers in Exercise 2; compare outcomes.

## Discussion Prompts
- Benefits of models (cost, safety, what-if exploration).
- Deterministic vs stochastic results; why repeat runs?
- Assumptions vs realism; how to validate?

## Assessment
- Collect worksheet + code snippets showing parameter changes.
- Quick oral check: explain one scenario and its outcome trend.
- Optional: short reflection linking parameter changes to observed trends.
