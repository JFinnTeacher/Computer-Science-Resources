# Modelling & Simulation (ALT 3) – Python Exercises

Two classroom-ready exercises for Leaving Cert Computer Science (Ireland), aligned with ALT 3 outcomes. No external libraries required for logic; optional plotting uses matplotlib.

## Files
- `exercise_1_fish_population.py` – Deterministic population model with parameter tuning + optional plotter.
- `exercise_2_random_walk_infection_lite.py` – Simple stochastic simulation (no classes/dicts) + optional plotter.
- `Student_Worksheet.md` – One-page scaffold for recording scenarios and observations.
- `Teacher_Guide.md` – Timing, differentiation, and assessment notes.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure Python 3.8+.
2. Optional: `pip install matplotlib` for charts.
3. Run each `.py` file and adjust parameters.
4. Record results in `Student_Worksheet.md`.

## Learning Outcomes (LCCS ALT 3)
- 3.8 Develop a model to test different scenarios
- 3.9 Analyse and interpret simulation outcomes before and after modifications
- 3.10 Explain agent-based and emergent behaviour (covered in Exercise 2 lite)
