# üîπ Sorting Algorithms ‚Äì Coding Exercises

## 1. **Selection Sort Exercises**
**Goal:** Practice finding the minimum and swapping.

**Exercise 1.1 ‚Äî Manual Minimum Swap**  
- Write a function that takes a list and finds the smallest number in the list.  
- Swap it with the first element.  
- Print the modified list.

**Exercise 1.2 ‚Äî Full Selection Sort**  
- Extend your function so it keeps repeating the process to fully sort the list.  
- Test it with `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`.

**Exercise 1.3 ‚Äî Step Tracker**  
- Modify your function so that after each pass, it prints the list (so you can see how the list is sorted step by step).

---

## 2. **Insertion Sort Exercises**
**Goal:** Practice shifting elements into the right position.

**Exercise 2.1 ‚Äî Insert One Card**  
- Imagine a list that is partly sorted: `[3, 7, 9, | 5]` (the vertical bar separates sorted and unsorted).  
- Write code to insert ‚Äú5‚Äù into the correct place among the sorted numbers.

**Exercise 2.2 ‚Äî Full Insertion Sort**  
- Create a function that sorts an entire list using the insertion sort technique.  
- Test it with `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]`.

**Exercise 2.3 ‚Äî Counting Shifts**  
- Modify your function so that it counts how many ‚Äúshifts‚Äù (moving items one step right) occur during the sorting process.  
- Print the total shifts used to sort the list.

---

## 3. **Bubble Sort Exercises**
**Goal:** Demonstrate repeated pairwise comparison and swapping.

**Exercise 3.1 ‚Äî One Bubble Pass**  
- Write a function that performs **just one pass** of bubble sort on `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`.  
- Print the result.

**Exercise 3.2 ‚Äî Full Bubble Sort**  
- Extend the code to keep repeating passes until the entire list is sorted.  
- Print the list after each pass.

**Exercise 3.3 ‚Äî Optimized Bubble Sort**  
- Modify your bubble sort so it stops early if *no swaps* are made in a pass.  
- Compare how many passes are needed on:  
  - `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (already sorted)  
  - `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (reverse order)

---

## 4. **Quicksort Exercises (Higher Level)**
**Goal:** Understand recursion and partitioning.

**Exercise 4.1 ‚Äî Partition Step Only**  
- Write a function that picks the **last element as pivot** and rearranges the list so smaller numbers are on the left, and larger numbers are on the right.  
- Test with `[10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70]`.

**Exercise 4.2 ‚Äî Full Recursive Quicksort**  
- Implement Quicksort using recursion.  
- Test with `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`.

**Exercise 4.3 ‚Äî Quicksort Variation**  
- Change your implementation so the pivot is chosen at **random** instead of the last element.  
- Compare the performance on different datasets.

---

# üîπ **Extension Exercises ‚Äì For Stronger Students**
These require deeper thinking about efficiency, complexity, and edge cases.

**Extension 1 ‚Äî Timing Comparisons**  
- Use Python‚Äôs `time` module to measure how long each algorithm takes to sort:  
  - A list of 100 random numbers  
  - A list of 100 numbers already sorted  
  - A list of 100 numbers in reverse order  
- Record and compare results.

**Extension 2 ‚Äî Hybrid Sort**  
- Write a function that uses **Insertion Sort** for small lists (length < 10) and **Quicksort** for larger lists.  
- Test it on various list sizes.

**Extension 3 ‚Äî Visualization Challenge**  
- Using `matplotlib`, create a bar chart that updates at each step of a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort).  
- The bars should move as the sort progresses, visually showing the sorting process.

**Extension 4 ‚Äî Compare and Reflect**  
- Create a table showing for each algorithm:  
  - Best case comparisons  
  - Worst case comparisons  
  - Memory usage  
- Write a short reflection: Which one makes sense to use in real-world programming, and why?

üëâ This way, students get **guided templates** to fill in, rather than having to start from a blank screen ‚Äî ideal for learning progression.

Jim, do you want me to also design a **student worksheet version** (without code, just pseudocode prompts and guiding questions), so you could differentiate between programming vs conceptual learners?
